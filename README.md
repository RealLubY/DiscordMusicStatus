# DiscordMusicStatus
This is a little script that changes your discord custom status to the song name you are currently listening.
This only works with youtube music, scince thats the platform i prefer, and the tab must be the active one.
You can just open the tab in a new window for example.

## Usage
add your discord token to the cfg.ini
